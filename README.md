# Angular Lazy Loading and Dynamic Injection Sample Project

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.6. This module uses a local version of Angular CLI so you don't have to install it globally :thumbsup:

## Development server

Run `npm run serve` or `yarn run serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests or e2e tests

Unit testing has been stripped from this project, if you want to bring it back just add the missing packages and test configurations from the original [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) project.

## Further help

If you want to improve this project feel free to contribute.
